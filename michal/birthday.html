<h1>Michal &hearts;</h1>
<p>For you this artooie box of lunch,<br>
To carry for us a future brunch,<br>
And we will pack our noms with love,<br>
For when we fly our kites above.</p>

<p>For you this kitty cake of cookie,<br>
With more love than Han loves his Wookiee,<br>
Green and purple frosting treats,<br>
Cannot compare to my kitty-sweets.</p>

<p>For you a year of my rachelheart,<br>
Since Star Wars flowers became art,<br>
I have been yours, and you have been mine,<br>
You always shall be, my dear meowshine.</p>

<h2>Hugs and Loves,<br>Rachel</h2>
